Instead of having a list of plain links to open one at a time, ExLinks will save you a ton of time by turning the links into something useful. Let this picture act as a demonstration:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Example](http://i.imgbox.com/abhzY8VS.png)\r\n\r\n## IMPORTANT\r\n\r\nMake sure you remove any pre-2.0.0 versions (1.7.4 or older) of ExLinks from your userscripts before installing ExLinks from here!\r\n\r\n## Installation (Chrome)\r\n1. Make sure you have [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).\r\n2. Install the userscript by clicking the big install link above.\r\n\r\n## Installation (Firefox)\r\n1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).\r\n2. Install the userscript by clicking the big install link above.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf something seems to be failing, **make sure all of your software is up to date.** Guaranteed minimums are Chrome 21 and Firefox 14, but you really should be always running the latest stable versions if possible.","google":"UA-34357165-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
