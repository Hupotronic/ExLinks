Instead of having a list of plain links to open one at a time, ExLinks will save you a ton of time by turning the links into something useful. Let this picture act as a demonstration:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Example](http://i.imgbox.com/abhzY8VS.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation (Chrome)\r\n1. Modify your Chrome shortcut to include `--enable-easy-off-store-extension-install` and relaunch it.\r\n2. Install userscript.\r\nAlternatively:\r\n1. Download userscript to your computer.\r\n2. Drag it to the Extensions page.\r\n\r\n## Installation (Firefox)\r\n1. Make sure you have Greasemonkey.\r\n2. Install the script.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nExLinks is compatible with both vanilla 4chan and 4chan X, as well as any linkification plugins.\r\nStylistically ExLinks is also compatible with OneeChan and 4chan Style Script.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf something seems to be failing, **make sure all of your software is up to date.** ExLinks has been tested with Chrome 21 and Firefox 14, so if you're running anything lower update first and see if that fixes the issue."}
