{"name":"Exlinks","tagline":"A userscript to make E-Hentai & ExHentai links on 4chan & Foolz archive more useful.","body":"#[CLICK HERE TO INSTALL EXLINKS](https://github.com/Hupotronic/ExLinks/raw/stable/ExLinks.user.js)\r\n\r\nExLinks is a userscript created for Chrome and Firefox that makes browsing Sad Panda threads a much nicer experience. Instead of having a list of plain links to open one at a time, ExLinks will save you a ton of time by turning the links into something useful. Let this picture act as a demonstration:\r\n\r\n\r\n![Example](http://i.imgbox.com/abhzY8VS.png)\r\n\r\n## For users of HTTPS Everywhere (or similar)\r\n\r\nExLinks is only guaranteed to work properly over HTTP due to the E-Hentai API being HTTP-only, and as such, if you open any threads where ExLinks would do something, it will automatically redirect you from HTTPS to HTTP to work properly. If you use [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), this can lead to infinite HTTPS->HTTP->HTTPS redirection. **As such, you will need to disable the plugin (or any similar HTTPS redirection plugins) for 4chan in order to ensure that ExLinks will work properly.** [See here for instructions.](http://hupotronic.github.io/ExLinks/)\r\n\r\n## Installation (Chrome)\r\n1. Make sure you have [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/).\r\n2. Install the userscript by clicking the big install link above.\r\n\r\n## Installation (Firefox)\r\n1. Make sure you have [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).\r\n2. Install the userscript by clicking the big install link above.\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\nIf something seems to be failing, **make sure all of your software is up to date.** Guaranteed minimums are Chrome 21 and Firefox 14, but you really should be always running the latest stable versions if possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you don't have a pre-2.0.0 version (1.7.4 or older) of ExLinks installed, as it will conflict with ExLinks 2.X.X.","google":"UA-34357165-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
